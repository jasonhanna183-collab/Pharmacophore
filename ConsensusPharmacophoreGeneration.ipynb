    "## üß¨ What Pharmit Does When You Upload an .sdf with Multiple Molecules\n",
    "\n",
    "When you click ‚ÄúLoad Features‚Äù (or upload an .sdf or .mol2 file with multiple molecules), Pharmit only uses the first molecule in the file to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate the pharmacophore\n",
    "\n",
    "Display the 3D structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Create shape-based searches\n",
    "\n",
    "The other molecules are ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üí° Why This Happens\n",
    "\n",
    "Pharmit is designed for interactive pharmacophore-based virtual screening, not multi-ligand consensus modeling.\n",
    "Its workflow assumes:\n",
    "\n",
    "One ligand ‚Üí generate pharmacophore ‚Üí search databases for similar molecules.\n",

    "\n",
    "Calculate hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, hydrophobics, aromatics, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Display the molecular surface and features.\n",
    "\n",
    "There‚Äôs currently no built-in function in Pharmit to merge or average features across multiple hits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### INSTEAD - First Generate consensus pharmacophore model with RDKIT:\n",
    "\n",
    "this version of the RDKit script will take an .sdf file with many molecules (e.g. 1000 hits) and build a consensus pharmacophore that combines the common features across all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "It automatically:\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeds + aligns all molecules in 3D\n",
    "\n",
    "Detects features (H-bond donors, acceptors, aromatics, hydrophobics)\n",
    "\n",
    "Clusters nearby features spatially to merge them into consensus points\n",
    "\n",
    "Outputs a Pharmit-compatible .phar file\n",
